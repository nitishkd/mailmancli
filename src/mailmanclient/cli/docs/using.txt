Initialization
==============

The CLI can be started by running ./mmclient [options|arguments]

If the mmclient is run without any arguments, the shell
is started, else the specified action is performed. Use EOF
to exit the shell.

    $./mmclient 
    Mailman Command Line Interface v1.0
    >>>
    Bye!

    $./mmclient [options]

If you have non-default login credentials, specify them with the
following options

    --host HOSTNAME       [defaults to http://127.0.0.1]
    --port PORTNUMBER     [defaults to 8001]
    --restuser USERNAME   [defaults to restadmin]
    --restpass PASSWORD   [defaults to restpass]

Domains
=======

This section describes the domain related functions that can be performed
with the CLI.

To create a new domain,

    $./mmclient create domain testdomain.org

To list the domains in the system,
    
    $./mmclient show domain
    http://domain.org

To obtain a detailed listing, use the `-v`/`--verbose` switch.
The detailed listing of domains displays the domains as a table.

    $./mmclient show domain -v
    Base URL           Contact address        Mail host    URL host
    http://domain.org  postmaster@domain.org  domain.org   domain.org

In addition, the long listing has a `no-header` switch that can be used 
to remove the header, making it more comfortable to pipe the output.

    $./mmclient show domain -v --no-header
    http://domain.org  postmaster@domain.org  domain.org   domain.org

To delete a domain

    $./mmclient delete domain domain.org

To supress the confirmation message, do
    
    $./mmclient delete domain domain.org --yes

To obtain a detailed description of a domain at one glance

    $./mmclient show domain domain.org

Mailing List
============

This section describes the mailing list related function that can be 
performed with the CLI.

To create a mailing list,

    $./mmclient create list list@domain.org

To display all mailing lists in the system

    $./mmclient show list
    foo.domain.org
    bar.example.org

To display the lists under the domain `domain.org`

    $./mmclient show list -d domain.org
    foo.domain.org

Further, a switch -v/--verbose can also be used to print a detailed listing.

    $./mmclient show list --verbose
    ID               Name    Mail host    Display Name    FQDN
    list.domain.org  list    domain.org   List            list@domain.org

Again, the `show list` supports a `--no-header` switch that removes
the header line of the long listing.

    $./mmclient show list --verbose --no-header
    list.domain.org  list    domain.org   List            list@domain.org

To delete a list

    $./mmclient delete list list@domain.org

To supress the confirmation message, do
    
    $./mmclient delete list list@domain.org --yes

To obtain a detailed description of a list at one glance

    $./mmclient show list list@domain.org

Adding and removing moderators can be performed using the CLI as follows

To get a list of members of a mailing list

    $./mmclient show-members list list@domain.org

The above command is equivalent to 
    
    $./mmclient show user --list list@domain.com

The command also supports flags like 
    
    --verbose Show a detailed listing
    --no-header Hide header in detailed listing

Refer the `show user` command for more details

To add moderators or owners

    ./mmclient add-moderator list list@domain.org --user a@b.com b@c.com
    ./mmclient add-owner list list@domain.org --user a@b.com b@c.com

And to remove moderators or owners

    ./mmclient remove-moderator list list@domain.org --user a@b.com b@c.com
    ./mmclient remove-owner list list@domain.org --user a@b.com b@c.com

The add and remove commands support the action on a list of users 
at once. Success or failure messages are provided upon completion or
failure of an action. The messages can be supressed by using a quiet flag.

    ./mmclient remove-moderator list list@domain.org --user a@b.com b@c.com --quiet

If the action fails for a user, the user is ignored and the action continues
without stalling.

User
====

To create a new user

    $./mmclient create user foo@bar.com --name "Foo" --password "password"

The `show user` command lists a single email ID of each user.

    $./mmclient show user 
    foo@bar.com

To list users who are members of a list

    $./mmclient show user --list list@domain.org
    foo@bar.com

The show command also supports a `--verbose` switch 

    $./mmclient show user --verbose
    Display Name    Address       Created on                                                  User ID
    Foo             foo2@bar.com  2014-05-30T00:52:52.564634  220337223817757552725201672981303248133

and a `--no-header` switch

    $./mmclient show user --verbose --no-header
    Foo             foo2@bar.com  2014-05-30T00:52:52.564634  220337223817757552725201672981303248133

To delete a user

    $./mmclient delete user foo@bar.com

To supress the confirmation message, do
    
    $./mmclient delete user foo@bar.com --yes

To obtain a detailed description of a user at one glance

    $./mmclient show user foo@bar.com

Users can be subscribed to a mailing list by using the subscribe 
command

    $./mmclient subscribe user user1@bar.com user2@bar.com --list list@domain.org
    user1@bar.com subscribed to list@domain.org
    Failed to subscribe user2@bar.com : HTTP Error 409: Member already subscribed

Multiple users can be subscribed to the list at the same time.

Similarly, Users can be unsubscribed to a mailing list by using the unsubscribe 
command

    $./mmclient unsubscribe user user1@bar.com user2@bar.com --list list@domain.org
    user1@bar.com unsubscribed from list@domain.org
    user2@bar.com unsubscribed from list@domain.org

The feedback for the subscribe and unsubscribe actions can be supressed by
using the --quiet flag.

    $./mmclient subscribe user user1@bar.com user2@bar.com --list list@domain.org --quiet
    $./mmclient unsubscribe user user1@bar.com user2@bar.com --list list@domain.org --quiet

The subscribe and unsubscribe actions continue even if one the users 
fail to subscribe/unsubscribe to a list. A relevant feedback message is
provided if the --quiet flag is not enabled.
